# Reversi
## Asynchronous Programming
The goal of this project is to test asynchronous prgaming with NodeJS. Another goal is to ntegrate Mongodb for saving data.

### Program
The goals of this project will be realised by writing a multiplayer application of the Game "Reversi".

### Specifications
- Multiplyer with each player from a different connection.
- Use NodeJS, Jade and Mongodb stack.

### The Final Game
Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8Ã—8 uncheckered board. There are sixty-four identical game pieces called disks (often spelled "discs"), which are light on one side and dark on the other. Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned color facing up. During a play, any disks of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color.
